# Cloud Foundry concepts
Cloud Foundry is an open-source cloud app platform, providing a choice of clouds, developer
frameworks, and app services. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy, and scale apps. It is an open-source project and is available through a variety of private cloud distributions and public cloud instances. For more information, see [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry) on GitHub.
