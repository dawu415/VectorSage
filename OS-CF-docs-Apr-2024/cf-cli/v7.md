# Upgrading to cf CLI v7
The main goal of Cloud Foundry CLI (cf CLI) v7 and CAPI V3 is to unlock new app developer workflows for users who require granular control of their apps and other advanced deployment strategies. For more information, see [New Workflows Supported](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/v7.html#new-workflows) below. These workflows were previously limited by CAPI V2.
The cf CLI development team aims to provide:

* A seamless upgrade experience from cf CLI v6. Changes have been kept to a minimum. Where there are changes, the team has incorporated feedback from the community to simplify the cf CLI user experience.

* Details about breaking potential breaking changes and alternative workflows for scripting environments.
To understand the differences between specific commands, see [Command Differences](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/v7.html#differences) below.
For more information about CAPI V3, see the [CAPI V3 documentation](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#introduction). For more information about CAPI V2, see the [CAPI V2 documentation](http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/).

## New workflows supported by cf CLI v7
cf CLI v7 uses CAPI V3, which offers developers more granular control over their apps. It activates new workflows by exposing packages, droplets, builds, and processes. CAPI V3 also includes new resources. For example, sidecars, manifests, and deployments.
Some key new features available with the cf CLI v7 are:

* [Rolling App Deployments](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/rolling-deploy.html): Push updates to apps without incurring downtime.

* [Running cf push Sub-Step Commands](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/push-sub-commands.html): Exercise granular control over the cf push process. These commands break down the cf push process into sub steps that can run independently.

* [Pushing an App with Multiple Processes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/multiple-processes.html): Use a single command to push apps that run multiple processes. An example is a web app that has a UI process and a worker process.

* [Pushing Apps with Sidecar Processes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/sidecars.html): Run additional processes in the same container as your app.

* [Using Metadata](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/metadata.html): Add metadata to objects, for example, spaces, and apps. This helps with operating, monitoring, and auditing.

## Installing cf CLI v7
To install cf CLI v7, see the [README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) in the Cloud Foundry CLI repository on GitHub. It includes instructions for downloading the latest CAPI release candidate, which is what the cf CLI v7 beta is tested against.

### Prerequisites
The cf CLI v7 requires [cf-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment) v13.5.0 or later.
This version of cf-deployment contains CAPI release v1.95.0, which provides the CAPI V3 API v3.85.0.
For more information, see the [CAPI release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release) and the [Cloud Controller release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng) on GitHub.
If you target an later version of cf-deployment, cf CLI v7 presents a warning saying that the API version is less than the minimum supported.
Not all commands run correctly.
For example, `cf apps` does not work.

## Command differences
These sections describe changes in commands from cf CLI v6 to cf CLI v7. They also provide important information for those who use the cf CLI in scripts.
For information about possible breaking changes, see the [Table of Differences](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/v7.html#table) below. This table includes removed flag options, removed commands, and removed or changed argument requirements.

### About scripting
If you have scripts that rely on the cf CLI, this section describes possible changes in cf CLI v7 which might affect scripts.
Some of these changes are:

* In cf CLI v7, if your scripts parse error text, output text errors are returned directly from CAPI. Where possible, cf CLI v7 no longer wraps errors it receives from the API.

* cf CLI v7 commands output errors and warnings to `stderr` rather than `stdout` to simplify debugging.

* Style changes including flavor text updates. For more information, see [Colors](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/wiki/CF-CLI-Style-Guide#colors) in *CF CLI Style Guide* in the Cloud Foundry CLI repository on GitHub.

* Key-value and table column headers are displayed in lowercase.

* Single-quote resource names appear in error cases.

**Caution**
If the services attribute is declared at the top-level of the manifest.yml file, cf CLI v6 generates a warning, but in cf CLI v7, there is no warning and the app is still pushed.

### Exit codes
cf CLI v7 attempts to consistently apply the principles of idempotency across all commands which require it. For more information, see [General Principles](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/wiki/CF-CLI-Style-Guide#general-principles) in *CF CLI Style Guide* in the Cloud Foundry CLI repository on GitHub. Commands now exit `0` if the outcome a user expresses when running a specific command is unchanged after the command is executed. Examples include:

* Attempting to delete a resource which does not exist, for example, a space. Commands like `delete-route` and `delete-space` return `0` in those cases.

* If the `create-buildpack` command fails to create a buildpack, the command exits with `1` instead of `0`, which is the current cf CLI v6 behavior.

### Table of differences
The following table summarizes how commands differ between cf CLI v7 and cf CLI v6.
| Command | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| `cf add-network-policy` | * **[Removed flag]:** The flag `--destination-app` is deprecated. Instead, the destination app is the required second argument, using no flag.
|
| `cf apps` | * **[Update]:** Displays information about `processes`.

* **[Update]:** The `url` field is renamed to `routes`.

* **[Update]:** Information about `instances`, `memory`, and `disk` is removed.

* **[Update]:** Apps are listed alphabetically.

* **[Removed flag]:** `--disable`. You can not deactivate a buildpack upon creation.

* **[Update]:** Creating a buildpack with position set to `0` is no longer valid.
|
| `cf create-domain` | * **[Renamed]:** This command is renamed to `create-private-domain`.
|

|
| `cf delete` | * **[Change in flag behavior]:** `-r` no longer deletes routes when the route is mapped to more than one app.
|
| `cf delete-domain` | * **[Renamed]:** This command is renamed to `delete-private-domain`.

* **[Update]:** When the `-e` flag is specified, plan costs advertised by the service broker are displayed.

* **[Update]:** When the `-e` flag is specified, and no service offering with that name is found, the exit code returned is 0. This is in contrast to the cf CLI v6, which returned exit code 1 in this case.
|
| `cf migrate-service-instances` | *This command is removed.* |
| `cf packages` | * **[Update]:** Displays packages from most recent to least recent.
|
| `cf push` | * **[Removed flag]:** `--route-path`. You can use the `routes` property in the manifest instead.

* **[Added environment variable]:** `all_proxy`. Specifies a proxy server for all requests.
|
| `cf start` | * **[Update]:** Stages an app to support `cf push app --no-start` use cases. If there is a new package, `start` stages and starts using the new package. If the app has been rolled back, `start` starts using the droplet you used to roll back your app. In the case of a droplet that is in a `FAILED` state, `start` ignores the failed droplet and restages the latest `READY` package to try to produce a healthy droplet. In cf CLI v6, `start` fails if the droplet is in a `FAILED` state.

|
| `cf apply-manifest` | * **[Update]:** If no flags are passed, the command defaults to using the manifest located in your `pwd`.
|
| `cf v3-cancel-zdt-push` | * *This command is removed. Instead, use `cf cancel-deployment`.*
|
| `cf v3-zdt-push` | * *This command is removed. Instead, use `--strategy rolling` flag with `cf push`.*
|
| `cf buildpacks` | * The order of the columns are changed. The buildpack column header is renamed.
