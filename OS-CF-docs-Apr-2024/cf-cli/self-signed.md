# Using the cf CLI with a self-signed certificate
This topic describes how developers use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI)
to communicate securely with a Cloud Foundry deployment with a self-signed certificate.
You can use the cf CLI to communicate securely with a Cloud Foundry deployment without
specifying `--skip-ssl-validation` under the following conditions:

* The deployment uses a self-signed certificate.

* The deployment uses a certificate that is signed by a self-signed certificate authority (CA), or a certificate signed by a certificate that is signed by a self-signed CA.
Before following the procedure below, the developer must obtain either the self-signed certificate or the intermediate and CA certificates used to sign the deploymentâ€™s certificate. The developer can obtain these certificates from the Cloud Foundry operator or from the deployment manifest. For more information about how to retrieve certificates from the deployment manifest, see [Securing Traffic into Cloud Foundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/securing-traffic.html).

## Installing the certificate on physical machines
The certificates you must insert into your local trust store vary depending on the configuration of your deployment:

* If the deployment uses a self-signed certificate, you must insert the self-signed certificate into your local trust store.

* If the deployment uses a certificate that is signed by a self-signed CA, or a certificate signed by a certificate that is signed by a self-signed CA, you must insert the self-signed certificate and any intermediate certificates into your local trust store.

### Installing the Certificate on Mac OS X
To place the certificate file `server.crt` into your local trust store for Mac OS X:

1. Run:
```
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain server.crt
```

### Installing the certificate on Linux
To place the certificate file `server.crt` into your trust store for Linux:

1. Run one of the following commands, depending on your Linux distribution:

* For Debian, Ubuntu, or Gentoo, run:
```
cat server.crt >> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

* For Fedora or RHEL, run:
```
cat server.crt >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```
The previous examples set the certificate permanently on your machine across all users and require `sudo` permissions. To set the certificate only in your current terminal or script, run one of these commands:

* Option 1:
```
export SSL_CERT_FILE=PATH-TO-SERVER.crt
```
Where `PATH-TO-SERVER.crt` is the filepath of the `server.crt` certificate file.

* Option 2:
```
export SSL_CERT_DIR=PATH-TO-SERVER-DIRECTORY
```
Where `PATH-TO-SERVER-DIRECTORY` is the directory of the `server.crt` certificate file.

### Installing the certificate on Windows
To place the certificate file `server.crt` into your local trust store for Windows:

1. Right-click the certificate file.

2. Click **Install Certificate**.

3. Choose to install the certificate as the **Current User** or **Local Machine**.

4. From the certification store list, select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.
