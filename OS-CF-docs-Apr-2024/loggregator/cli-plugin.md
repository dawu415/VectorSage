# Installing the Loggregator Firehose Plug-in for cf CLI
You can use the Loggregator Firehose Plug-in for the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).
The Loggregator Firehose plug-in for the cf CLI allows Cloud Foundry admins to access the output of the Loggregator Firehose. The output of the Firehose includes logs and metrics from apps deployed on Cloud Foundry as well as metrics from Cloud Foundry platform components. For more information about the Firehose, see the [Loggregator Architecture](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/architecture.html#loggregator-architecture) section of the *Loggregator Architecture* topic.
For more information about using plug-ins with the cf CLI, see [Using cf CLI plug-ins](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/use-cli-plugins.html).
You can deactivate the Firehose. In place of the Firehose, you can configure an aggregate log and metric drain for your foundation:
