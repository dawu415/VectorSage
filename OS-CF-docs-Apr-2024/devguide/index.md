# App developer guide
This guide provides instructions for deploying, running, and managing apps and services with Cloud Foundry.

## Overview
Developing, running, and managing apps on Cloud Foundry might include:

* Deploying and scaling apps with diverse languages, frameworks, and dependencies

* Finding software services in the services Marketplace, such as databases, email, or message servers

* Creating your own Cloud Foundry service based on an external server

* Creating service instances and binding them to your apps

* Streaming app logs to an external log management service

* Troubleshooting app deployment and health
If you do these things, you are a Cloud FoundryÂ **developer**, and the contents of this guide are for you.
